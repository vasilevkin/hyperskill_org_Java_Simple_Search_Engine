  <p>Write a program that implements <strong>a simple load balancer</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The program must read tasks from the standard input and distribute them between two queues. Tasks will be processed by a system (in the future). Each task has a unique identifier and a number indicating the load on the system (in parrots).</p> 
  <p>The balancer should distribute tasks between queues by the following rule: the task is added to the lower-load queue (by the total load). If both queues have the same total load indicator, the task must be added to the first queue.</p> 
  <p>It's guaranteed, the input data contain at least two tasks.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input data format</strong></p> 
  <p>The first line contains the number of tasks. Other lines consist of task description: an identifier and a load indicator (separated by a space).</p> 
  <p><strong>Output data form</strong></p> 
  <p>The first line should contain identifiers of tasks in the first queue, the second line should contain the identifiers in the second queue.</p>
